# MQuestions

## Overview
Write up and solutions to several recent questions I've worked on, along with added tests.

All feedback welcome.

## Problems Outlined

**First question**
Find the max sum of k contiguous elements in an unsorted array of positive integers

Example Input: `[ 1, 2, 10, 5, 3]`, `k = 3`

Example Output: `18`

**Second question**
Given node properties of data, left and right, take in a node of a binary tree and print out the tree's node from the bottom up in a breadth-first reverse order
Example input:
          `7
        /      \
     8             10
  /      \        /
12       13     16`

Example output: `12,13,16,8,10,7` 
>hint try using a stack and queue for a more elegant solution

**Third question**
Find if two elements in array of unsorted integers equal a given sum

Example input: `120`, `[10, 30, 20, 50, 110, 40]`

Example output: `true`

If time, also explain the BigO of time and space complexity for your solution

**Fourth question**
Reverse characters of a char array in place and return the reversed array

Example input: `[C,L,A,S,S,I,C]`

Example output: `[C,I,S,S,A,L,C]`
